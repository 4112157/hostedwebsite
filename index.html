                      <p>Blueberry cakes are one of the easiest cakes to make. Whip up a plain vanilla cake batter and throw in yur blueberries - fresh or frozen, either works well. If using fresh berries, coat them in flour to help prevent them from sinking. You can do the same with frozen berries, but make sure to use them straight out of the freezer to prevent your batter from turning blue.</p>

                         <p>A simple banana cake with a lemon cream cheese icing. When choosing bananas for baking, it is best to use older / overripe bananas because their sugars have had a longer time to develop. This gives the cake a deeper flavour. Too many of you wussies are scared of brown bananas, when those have a carry more flavour than perfect looking bananas. Even if the skin of your banana is completely brown, it doesn't necessarily mean it is rotten - you'll know a rotten banana when it is mushy and sour-smelling. Anyways, top your cake with banana chips or nuts. Or if you're feeling a little bold, top it with freshly sliced bananas and let it oxidize and turn brown and slimy!</p>

                      <p>Our take on a fruitcake recipe full of candied and dried fruit, nuts, and spices. This cake is quite dry on it's own, so before serving, completely soak your slice in brandy or whiskey. This adds that classic fruitcake flavour, as well as moisture. Consider serving the cake with serveral shots on the side, keeping yourself and your guests extra happy. :D</p>

Every element of this cake has flowers in it, from the cake to the icing. This cake is full of flowers for the sake of being full of flowers.

                      <p>We all know that gluten free cakes aren't usually the tastiest- and this recipe proves just that. To make this cake all you need is one litre of water, A loaf of Gerry's of your choosing and your ptsd medecations. Begin by using approximately 250ml of water to wash down your meds. Then, whizz the bread up in a food processor. Or, if you are feeling angsty, pulverise it with your fists. Once you have your breadcrumbs, add enough water to make a workable dough. Press the dough into your lined cake pan, and bake for 15 minutes. Make or buy some meringues to top the cake with and lessen the sad. Now you are ready to serve and turn that coeliac frown upside down!</p>

                      <p>You don't have to wait until easter to enjoy this chocolate egg cake. This chocolate cake is embedded with boiled quail eggs in it's crumb giving every bite an interesting texture. Top with unpeeled eggs, serve and enjoy as you ponder whether the chicken or the egg came first; whether the universe is a vast comsic egg; and who was the first human to find an egg and decide "oh a bird's butt-rock full of slimey gooey- Let's have a taste... NOM"</p>

                        <p>Who doesn't love a cake that reminds you of ketchup? This tomato cake incorporated tomato puree into the buttercream for a slight tang. The cake is decorated with fresh tomato slices to prevent the cake from going dry; making the most out of the moisture from the tomato slices as they liquify throughout the day!</p>
